  FAQ: "FAQs",
  FAQ1Q: "How do I migrate save files?",
  FAQ1A: "To migrate save files, please ensure that the server has just been created in the palserver GUI (not yet activated). Copy and paste the original save files (Dedicated server save: /SaveGames/0/some ID; Four-player save: /SaveGames/some ID/your map file ID) into /SaveGames/0/47D51DB549971BDC025E4BA00A549007, then start the server to complete the process.",
  FAQ2Q: "Why can't map files be correctly modified, with changes being overwritten each time?",
  FAQ2A: "This is due to the bidirectional backup caused by the tool, where content in the SaveGames folder will be overwritten. The approach is to always create a new server when you need to modify save files, and do so before starting the server.",
  FAQ3Q: "After migrating a four-player save file to a dedicated server, why does the host's data disappear?",
  FAQ3A: "The official mechanism for identifying player IDs results in the inability to access the server owner's data. The current version requires the use of a conversion tool to transform the server owner's data into a file format that can be read by dedicated servers. You can access the conversion tool through this link: https://github.com/xNul/palworld-host-save-fix. The detailed process is as follows: First, create a new server and open the server folder. Then, copy the four-player save file and start the server. Play in the server and exit normally, then shut down the server. After that, run the palworld-host-save-fix tool to convert the file. Finally, create a new server, paste the converted save file into the new server, and start it to complete the setup!",
  FAQ4A: "Please create a new server, copy and paste the save file, and before starting, find a file called WorldOption.sav. Deleting or renaming it will make the settings take effect!",
  FAQ5Q: "Why don't the world settings for hatching or base limits take effect?",
  FAQ5A: "The recommended approach is to use mods, or you can use the configuration method of WorldOption.sav. For a detailed solution, refer to the latter half of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LqoN-pjb-0&t=6s",
