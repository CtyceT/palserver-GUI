To migrate save files, please ensure that the server is created in the palserver GUI before it's activated (not yet enabled).

Simply copy and paste the original save file into \SaveGames\0\47D51DB549971BDC025E4BA00A549007, and starting the server will complete the process.

Dedicated server save file location: (\SaveGames\0\some ID)
Four-player server save file location: (\SaveGames\some ID\your map file ID)

Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: After migrating a four-player save file to a dedicated server, why does the host's data disappear?
A: Yes, because the official mechanism for identifying player IDs results in the host's data being inaccessible. The current version relies on a conversion tool to transform the host's data into a file that can be read by the dedicated server: https://github.com/xNul/palworld-host-save-fix. Follow the steps above to complete the process.

(If it feels troublesome, you can also transfer the ownership of the base to another player in four-player mode, hand over Palu to another player, and put supplies in a chest, and then migrate it directly before transferring the ownership back, which is also okay.)

Q: After migrating a four-player save file to a dedicated server, why don't the adjusted world settings take effect?
A: Please create a new server, copy and paste the save file, and before starting, find a file called WorldOption.sav. Deleting or renaming it will make the settings take effect!

Q: Why don't the world settings for hatching or base limits take effect?
A: The recommended approach is to use mods, or you can use the configuration method of WorldOption.sav. For a detailed solution, refer to the latter half of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LqoN-pjb-0&t=6s

Q: Why can't map files be correctly modified, with changes being overwritten each time?
A: This is due to the bidirectional backup caused by the tool, where content in the SaveGames folder will be overwritten. The approach is to always create a new server when you need to modify save files, and do so before starting the server.
